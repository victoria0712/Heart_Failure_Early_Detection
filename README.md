# Heart_Failure_Early_Detection

## Description
This collaborative repository showcases a group project involving six members. Our goal was to enhance patient care, education, and research at NHCS through analytics, machine learning, and AI. We conducted comprehensive research on national health, engaged stakeholders, and harnessed available resources to identify validated ideas. Our project includes data cleaning, visualizations, and the utilization of various machine learning models – including logistic regression, CART, and random forest – to predict outcomes using all features, six features, and four features. Based on our prototypes, we propose strategic solutions for implementing these models effectively.
